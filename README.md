# Java-Minesweeper-Project
Libraries from the website for my Java textbook are necessary to run this code.

Cell.java:
This class sets the attributes for each individual cell in the game.
In this file, my professor K. Walsh provided basic parts of the class as a shell for me to fill in and use for the game. The parts that he provided include cell states: final variable size, isMine, redMine, isRevealed, and coastIsClear. The contents of each cell state including the ones I just listed I created or filled in myself. The rest of this Cell.java class I wrote on my own. My professors paragraph comment instructions are left in so it is clear what was asked of me in this project.

Game.java:
This class is responsible for most of the game logic and functionality of the game. Again my professor started us off with a shell of the class and left paragraph comments for directions of what he wanted from us. My original code is separated from what my professor wrote by large comments of slashes. There are two large comments of slashes to separate out the code, my original code is in between the two of them and code my professor wrote is on the outsides of them. In addition to the code I wrote separated by the large comments, I added a few variables here and there depending on what I needed.
